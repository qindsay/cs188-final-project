# CS188 Final Project
This repository is the Spring 2025 final project for UCLA's CS188 (Intro to Robotics) course taught by Professor Yuchen Cui. 

## Project Overview
This is the default project, which completes the Square Assembly task from Robosuite. The robot observes multiple demonstrations and learns to reproduce the behavior required to complete the task successfully. We used advanced DMPs to complete this task. 

## How to Run:
1. Make sure you have already installed robosuite before running.
   ```pip install robosuite```
2. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/qindsay/cs188-final-project.git
    cd cs188-final-project
3. Run the code: ```mjpython test_ca3.py```
